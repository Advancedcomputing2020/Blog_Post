# Climate Change Impact on Agriculture
This project is to derive correlation between changing global temperature affecting agriculture in India
Update:14/01/21 - Worked on building Rainfall and GHG emissions correlation
## Getting Started
This repository uses Python 3.9.1.

* We use [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) and [pyenv-virtualenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-virtualenv) to manage python version and virtual environment.
* The `requirements.txt` is provided just in case you want to use other virtual environment management.
## Motivation

I was interested in working on this topic due to following :
[**Temperory]
1. How are has increasing global temperature had an impact on the rice yield in the past 30 years in india?
2. How does extreme weather conditions affect the viability of certaim crops?
3. How does soil get affected due to climate change?
## Usage

1. First, make sure you have everything in requirements.txt installed. For quick installation, run below
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
2. Download the [https://ourworldindata.org/crop-yields](Data for Yields of crops) data and put it inside folder `data/annual_csv.csv`.
3. For quick run, open up Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab, and then just **Run All**.
